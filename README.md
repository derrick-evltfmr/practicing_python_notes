===============================================================================

There are still some more notes planned to update in this repo,
like **Beautifulsoup package** (to pull data out of HTML and XML), **Selenium package** (web browser automation), **hashlib package** (check whether the document was updated), **Matplotlib package** (draw in 2D), **Bokeh package** (draw simple chart, like light ver of Matplotlib)...

But due to personal learning precedence, since now I'm able to understand the basics of Python and use it to do some simple development, I would like to learn some other skills that will be helpful to me and do some more practical projects first, therefore, this repo is temporarily suspended. Will update again some time later.
